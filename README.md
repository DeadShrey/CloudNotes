## Why CloudNotes?

Most note-taking tools feel either:
- Too bare, or
- Too heavy

CloudNotes sits in between:
- Simple like Notepad
- Persistent like the cloud
- Focused on the act of writing, not managing

## Features

- Clean, distraction-free editor
- Automatic saving
- Image support with predictable layout
- Turn-based collaboration via shareable note keys
- Login-based persistence

Collaboration is intentionally simple:
> Share a note key, take turns editing, stay in sync — no live cursor chaos.

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore
- Firebase Hosting

## Status

This is a personal project.
Features are added only when they feel necessary through actual use.
But any bugs are fixed as soon as they are reported.
